README - kinneret remastering scripts, version 0.1
this is a readme file for the kinneret remastering scripts
WARNING! those scripts may seriousley damage your system, especially if you are running them without knowing what you are doing.
you should consider downloading a pre-prepared ISO image, as those scripts are dangarous pre-alpha.
we have no responsability what so ever on any damage caused to information or your system by using those scripts.

this script package is supposed to work on KNOPPIX 3.2 30/03/2003 and will mostly fail to provide desired results on any other version of knoppix.

before running anything - 
-- you should extract the contents of the knoppix compressed file system into sorce/ . use the cp flag p to preserve file permissions. you may come across errors if you don't.
-- you should make sure the remaster/ directory is empty.
-- you should make sure you have the cloop tools, available at knoppix' homepage.
-- you should make sure you know what you're doing!

if you don't have enough space on your partition, you can symlink the source/ and remaster/ directories somewhere else.

steps in remastering -
become root by using su.
get into kinneret-remaster/ directory.
run ./dokinneret
this will take some time, depanding on the speed of your system (30~80 min)
while this is running you will notice uic generates "cannot open network socket"errors. 
this is a known problem, and does not appear to have any result on the outcome.
also, compiling sim generates some warnings, again - nothing serious.
next, make sure you have enough total memory (swap+ram) for compressing the fs
you will need at least 700MB of free memory.
run ./compressfs
run ./mkiso

you should now have your own home-made kinneret ISO in iso/

2. Installation instructions for installing the swimming guide documents

The instructions here are for version 0.7.

Please note the use of one menu for all locales (new)

- su
- {enter root password}
- cd {to the cvs directory where you imported the l2swim-docs directory
- cp l2swim-docs/etc/swim_menu*.txt /opt/kinneret/l2swim/etc/
- cp l2swim-docs/doc/he/* /opt/kinneret/l2swim/doc/he/
- cp l2swim-docs/doc/ar/* /opt/kinneret/l2swim/doc/ar/
- cp l2swim-docs/doc/en/* /opt/kinneret/l2swim/doc/en/
- cp l2swim-docs/doc/ru/* /opt/kinneret/l2swim/doc/ru/
- cp l2swim-docs/doc/image/* /opt/kinneret/l2swim/doc/image/

You also need to make sure you have a compiled binary in the path (e.g. /usr/bin) and additional image files in /opt/kinneret/images. You can find the image files in the 'etc/image/ directory.

NOTE: if you do not have the target directories, you have to create them.

5. Information for authors

The Swimming Guide is an application that has the capability to display
HTML pages.

Each document is a single HTML page that is accesible from a central menu.

The menu uses a special format which is not documented at this stage so it
is not recommended to mess with it at this point.

This menu contains links to the various documents that make up the Swimming
Guide repository.

The HTML documents are generated automaticaly from an XML file (the data
source) and an XSL (the stylesheet). The stylesheet is the same for all the
documents.

The various documents and related files are stored in the cvs. If you have
this file it is likely that you already have a local copy of the cvs.
But if you don't grab it using the instructions for anonymous access from
here:

http://developer.berlios.de/cvs/?group_id=734

Follow the instructions to download the modulename = l2swim-docs.

For writing documentation, you do not need to have the Swimming Guide 
program - you can "view" the HTML using any browser (currently I recommend
Konqueror since Mozilla and sons have a nasty bug in showing Hebrew lists).

If you want to test the real thing, you can find a precompiled binary in
the 'tmp' directory. Jusy copy it to /usr/bin and run it (l2swim).

As noted, the HTML documents are generated from an XML source and an XSL
template. for that, make sure you install xsltproc.

If you do not have xsltproc installed, you won't be able to generate the
HTMLs. You can still write documents but not test them, which is not
very good.
  
To build a single document, the following  

xsltproc -o l2swim-docs/doc/<locale>/<file>.html l2swim-docs/etc/l2swim.xsl l2swim-docs/src/<locale>/<manual>/<file>.xml

However, to make it easy for you to build the documents, all you have to do
is to be in the l2swim-docs directory and type:

make

That will automatically build all the relevant files.

Assuming that you have all the proper directories in /opt/kinneret and you
want to try the "real thing", you can install all the files with:

su
make install
exit

note this has to be run as root unless you give write permission to the 
/opt/kinneret directory to the user.

Now that you have everything set up, you can start writing documents.

At this point, there's no documentation for the various commands used in
the XML. However, you can find some comments inside the XSL:
http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/kinneret/l2swim-docs/etc/l2swim.xsl

And also use the existing documents as references:

http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/kinneret/l2swim-docs/src/

Once you get the cvs snapshot, you can view all these files locally.

TRANSLATORS:

For you the process is somewhat easier.

To get you started, grab the Hebrew document under src/he and copy it to
the destination folder, e.g. src/ar

Access the file using a text editor (please use utf-8 / unicode encoding),
and translate every Hebrew string to your destination language.

The only thing you will have to change in the XML is to look for 
<article lang="hebrew">
and replace the language to your language.

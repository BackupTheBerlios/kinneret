2. Installation instructions for remastering the Kinneret CD

The instructions here are for version 0.3 (Hermon).

Since the build process is not yet automated, precompiled document files are provided. Also, since the l2swim application does not yet support locales, a symbolic link has to be created in order for the application to work.

- su
- {enter root password}
- cd {to the cvs directory where you imported the l2swim-docs directory
- cp l2swim-docs/etc/swim_menu*.txt /opt/kinneret/l2swim/etc/
- ln -s /opt/kinneret/l2swim/etc/swim_menu_he.txt /opt/kinneret/l2swim/etc/swim_menu.txt
- cp l2swim-docs/doc/he/* /opt/kinneret/l2swim/doc/he/
- cp l2swim-docs/doc/image/* /opt/kinneret/l2swim/doc/image/

You also need to make sure you have a compiled binary in /opt/kinneret/bin and additional image files in /opt/kinneret/images. You can find a precompiled binary in the 'tmp' directory and the image files in the 'etc/image/ directory.

5. Build instrucions

xsltproc -o l2swim-docs/doc/<locale>/<file>.html l2swim-docs/etc/l2swim.xsl l2swim-docs/src/<locale>/<manual>/<file>.xml

You can find scripts (quite rude as for now...) in the 'bin' directory. To run them, switch to this directory and run the scripts (eg. ./mkdoc_he.sh). If you add new files/translations - make sure to add the files to the appropriate script.

Authors only: You can find a precompiled binary in the 'tmp' directory.

5. Build instrucions

xsltproc -o l2swim-docs/doc/<locale>/<file>.html l2swim-docs/etc/l2swim.xsl l2swim-docs/src/<locale>/<manual>/<file>.xml

You can find scripts (quite rude as for now...) in the 'bin' directory. To run them, switch to this directory and run the scripts (eg. ./mkdoc_he.sh). If you add new files/translations - make sure to add the files to the appropriate script.

How to write l2swim articles?
---------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very short overview to allow you to start. Make sure you read the README, l2swim.xsl and learn at least one practical example (an article) to learn how this works.

l2swim articles are HTML documents that are generated by applying a stylesheet (called l2swim.xsl) to a well-formatted XML document.

A plain article template will look as follows:

------------------------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<article lang="english">

	<title>name of the article</title>
	<copy>the license information</copy>
	<toc lang="english"/>
	<main>the body of the article</main>
</article>
------------------------------------------------
The above can be compiled as follows (assuming it is saved as temp.xml and the putput will be temp.html):

xsltproc -o temp.html etc/l2swim.xsl temp.xml

Make sure the relative path to l2swim.xsl is correct.

The language is specified in the <article> tag and can take the values hebrew, arabic, russian, english.

Each article will have the following segments:

- a title (optional) defined by the <title> tag
- a license box (optional) defined by the <copy> tag
- a table of contents (optional) defined by the <toc> tag
- the contents of the article defined by the <main> tag
- a footer (automatically generated by xsl)

As you can see above, <toc> takes only language parameter. That is because it is automatically generated from the <chapter> tags embedded in the <main> segment.

A chapter tag will add a numeric index to the chapter name and include it in the toc (if specified).

If you want a chapter with no index and no toc use <chapnotoc> instead.

Other useful tags can be located in the l2swim.xsl file, search for <xsl:template match="sometag"> where <sometag> designates the tag name. The xsl is documented.

It is recommended to start from an existing article and modify it as you need.

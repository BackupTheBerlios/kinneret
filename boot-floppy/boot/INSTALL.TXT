INSTALL:
--------

	you need to compile these files under CYGWIN
	get GRUB, for example in the directory /usr/local/src/grub-0.93
	install these files in grub-0.93/ntfsboot
	run "make" in the ntfsboot directory


Usage:
------

1) get a compiled stage1 and stage2 image and put these in C:\boot
   for example compiled on a linux machine

2) add the following line to the file C:\boot.ini

   C:\boot\stage1="GRUB"

   you may need to do 

	   ATTRIB -R -H -S C:\boot.ini

   to make the file visible and writable and 

	   ATTRIB +R +H +S C:\boot.ini

   to revert the attributes of the file

3) run grubinstall
   This will update the embedded blocklists in the files stage1 and stage2

   You should rerun this utility after moving/changing the files stage1 
   or stage2 and after running tools like defragmentation

   grubinstall [-d device] [-1 stage1] [-2 stage2] [-m menu] [-l] [-a]
   grubinstall [-s] [-1 stage1] [-2 stage2] [-m menu] [-l] [-a]
   grubinstall [-b] [-1 stage1] [-2 stage2]
   grubinstall [-i file] [-1 stage1] [-2 stage2]
       -d C:                  : partition where the files are
       -d (hd0,0)             : partition where the files are
       -1 C:\boot\stage1      : boot sector
       -2 C:\boot\stage2      : secondary boot loader
       -m /boot/menu.lst      : grub boot menu
       -l                     : force LBA mode
       -b                     : make boot floppy
       -i boot.img            : make boot disk image
       -s                     : scan partitions
       -a                     : alternate grub partition name for menu

       device can be a disk or GRUB partition identifier 
       stage1 and stage2 must be paths to win32 file names
 
   The defaults are such that if you put the files in C:\boot
   you can simply go for "grubinstall"

4) uninstall
   just delete the C:\boot directory, and remove the entry from C:\boot.ini
   as described in 1). No registry entries were used by using the tool.

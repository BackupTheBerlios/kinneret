Limitations:
------------
     booting OS'es from NTLDR requires stage1 to be on the same partition
     as NTLDR itself.

Changes:
--------
0.3: - initial version 
0.4: - added experimental FAT support (not released)
     - added support for DOS partition names 
           (ie. "C:" instead of "(hd0,0)")
           this works only on windows XP
0.5: - fixed bug with NTFS: hardcoded partition offset and clustersize
	replaced by information exposed by fsys_ntfs.c
     - fixed FAT support
     - added support for DOS path names 
       (ie. C:\boot\stage1 instead of "C:/boot/stage1");
     - code cleanup

Installing confwiz into knoppix:
You will need an uncompressed and writeable copy of knoppix.

The installation process is not the regulat Autoconf/Automake.

Installation procedure:
1. chroot into knoppix
2. Extract confwiz-x.y.z.tar.gz to a temporary directory (/tmp/)
3. cd into that directory
4. as root, run ./configure --with-qt-dir=/usr/share/qt3 --prefix=/usr
5. as root run 'make' followed by 'make install'
	NOTE: uic may report socket error. In that case, you will have to
	activate KDE as user 'knoppix' and through Konsole run 'sudo make' followed by
	'sudo make install'
6. 'make install' copied confwiz, confwiz.mo and other files. Verify these files:
/usr/bin/confwiz
/usr/share/locale/he/LC_MESSAGES/confwiz.mo
/etc/skel/.kde/Autostart/confwiz.desktop (must be there in final remaster, will be copied to /home/knoppix/ at boot)
/usr/kinneret/bin/config.sh
/usr/kinneret/bin/findfonts.sh
/usr/kinneret/bin/ttf.sh
7. After creating KNOPPIX compressed fs, and before burnning kinneret, put knoppix.sh that
is in scripts/ in the KNOPPIX directory next to the KNOPPIX fs.

Kinneret's Configuration Wizard Version 0.1 Beta
------------------------------------------------

Description:
The wizrad is a one-time wizard that makes the home
directory of the user saveable, and load TrueType fonts from
a Windows partition.

The wizard createsa sub directory named 'kinneret' in the root
of the selected vfat partition. In this directory, two files are
created:
.config - a 100MB ext3 filesystem
.swap - no more then 256MB of swap file

during boot, the script knoppix.sh mounts .config
to /home/knoppix/ and activates the swap file.
After the X server boots, a script loads the TrueType fonts.

How it works:
At boot time, the script knoppix.sh searches all the vfat partitions for a subdirectory
name 'kinneret'. If it can't find it, it creates a file in /tmp/ name foundhome and writes '0'
to it. If it finds 'kinneret', it runs fsck on .config, activates .swap and mounts .config to
/home/knoppix/. Afterwards it returns control to Knoppix's boot script.

Once KDE is up, confwiz.desktop that is in /home/knoppix/.kde/Autostart/ is called and launches
/usr/bin/confwiz. 'confwiz' does on of the two, if /tmp/foundhome does not exist, it simply launches
/opt/kinneret/bin/ttf.sh that erases the content of /home/knoppix/.fonts, scans the directories listed in
/home/knoppix/.fontsdirs and re-create symbolic links to all the *.ttf it finds in these directories in
/home/knoppix/.fontsdirs. Then it indexes the fonts with the regulat tools of xfs, adds /home/knoppix/.fonts
to xfs's fonts path and re-starts xfs. If confwiz finds /tmp/foundhome, it does not launches ttf.sh, but
it srarts in wizard mode. The wizard collects parameters and then passes them to /opt/kinneret/bin/config.sh.
config.sh creates the kinneret directory, mounts it to ~/ and activates the swap.
NOTE: tune2fs causes a temporary freeze for some reason.
After config.sh finishes, confwiz calls /opt/kinneret/bin/findfonts.sh that searches through all of the
vfat partitions available for /windows/fonts or /winnt/fonts. It appends directories that it find
to /tmp/.fontsdirs. confwiz then reads /tmp/.fontsdirs and allows the user to make changes in it through
a listbox interface. Once the user clicks next, confwiz creates ~/.fontsdirs and calles ttf.sh to load
the fonts. After the wizard is completed, confiwz launches /opt/kinneret/bin/pref if the checkbox was selected,
and after pref finishes, it launched /opt/kinneret/bin/swim. After 'swim' is done, confwiz exists.

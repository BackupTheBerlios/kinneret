"your home directory to it's root, imports TrueType fonts from an existing "
"Windows partition and creates a swap file so that at least 300M stays free, "
"and not larger then 256M. It is highly recommended to select this option.<BR/"
"> \n"
"<BR/> \n"
"<I>No Configuration</I> - No configuration is made at all, not home "
"directory is created, and no swap file or TrueType index is made.<BR/> \n"
"<BR/> \n"
"<I>Expert Mode</I> - Allows manual configuration of the working partition, "
"the home directory, the swap file and the TrueType fonts index. This option "
"is recommended for the use of Linux / Computers experts only.<BR/> \n"
"<BR/> \n"
"<U>Partition mapping under Linux</U><BR/> \n"
"In Linux, the partition mapping and naming method is different then the "
"method known to Windows users (C, D etc).<BR/> \n"
"In Linux, the naming is made by the physical structure and layout of the "
"partitions. Each hard-drive gets the prefix hd, to indicate it is a hard-"
"drive.<BR/> \n"
"Afterward, each physical drive gets a letter, a, b, c, or d, by their order, "
"e.g., the first drive on the first IDE device (the Primary Master) gets the "
"suffix a. the Secondary Master gets the letter b. the Primary Slave and the "
"Secondary Slave gets the letters c and d respectively.<BR/> \n"
"The string ends with a digit, representing the number of partition (starting "
"from 1). Therefore, hda1 will be the first partition on the first hard-drive "
"connected to the Primary IDE device. hda2 will be the second partition on "
"the hard-drive. hdb4 will be the fourth partition on the Secondary Master "
"etc.<BR/> \n"
"<BR/> \n"
"<U>How do I translate Linux mapping (hda1, hdc10 etc) to Windows mapping (C, "
"D etc)?</U><BR/> \n"
"There is not way of doing it directly because Windows maps drives without "
"relation to their physical order.<BR/> \n"
"In most Windows systems, incremental numbering of Windows style partitons "
"will match the incremental numbering of Linux partitions, meaning, hda1 will "
"be drive C, drive D will be either hda2 or hdb1 (depending on the number of "
"partitions on hda)<BR/> \n"
"<BR/> \n"
"Please note that this method will not work on all system, since Windows "
"allows the user to manually change letters of drives, and sometimes put the "
"CD-ROM(s) in the middle of the hard-drives and not at the end (so C and D "
"might be hard-drives, E will be a CD-ROM and F will be another hard-drive). "
"The method above should work for most system, but that is NOT guaranteed."

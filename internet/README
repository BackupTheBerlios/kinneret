Internet Tool v0.1
==================
The internet tool is designed to make life easier on new users to establish
a connection to the internet. The tool relies on a database that should
eventually hold all the Israeli ISPs (Internet Service Providers) and Modems.

You can checkup on the latests database at the development page of the tool at:
http://iwiz.linux-kinneret.org

As for version 0.1.1, the tool supports only broadband connections (ADSL and Cable).
I will add support for ISDN and Dial-up modems in the near future (next version should
already support these).

If you want to know more, you can read help/wizard.kwd(or pdf) and type ./internet --help
If you still can't find what you're looking for, mail me.

Getting it to work
------------------
The tool is being written as part of the Kinneret (http://www.linux-kinneret.org) project,
questions can be asked in the development forum.

In order to get the tool to work properly, you will have to make sure it can find it's database.
The tool has it's own configuration file, placed at /etc/internet.conf.
In this file you can set the database's directory.
NOTE: Write the path to the database including the trailing slash (/).
      The path that is written should be the path to deps.xml,
      not to the sub-directory db/.

Simply extract db/ from the tarball to the directory you have selected.
You can download the latest database from the development page.

After placing the database, all you have to do is extracting the executable (or compile it,
if you have downloaded the source code) and run it.

If you are compiling from source, you will have to download and install libxml2.
The tool expects to find libxml2's headers under /usr/include/libxml2/libxml/.

Stuff you need to know BEFORE running to tool
---------------------------------------------
* You should run the tool as a user that has both read and write permissions
  to the database directory and all of it's sub-directories (root will be a good idea).

* If you want to re-use the core code, you'll find the script internet/mklib.sh. after building the tool,
  run it, and you'll have libinternet.a file you can use in your app (notify me if you do so, please).

* The API is pretty simple, but not well-documented yet, mail me if you can't understand something.

* The wizard mode has been temporally disabled, it will be available again on the next version.

* When running in non-wizard mode, you MUST supply ALL of these arguments:
  --debian
  --isp
  --method
  --dialer
  --modem
  --dev
  --username
  --passwd
  --name
  Or else the tool won't have enough data to assemble the scripts.
  If the modem you have selected have a dual interface (USB and Ethernet), you must supply
  also the --iface flag.

* It is recommended to use the -v (verbose) flag, to see what's going on and to know why to tool broke down
  (send me the output when you report a bug/crash).

* Open the tarball that has been created under <DB path>/connections/
  (you can use the --extract option to do that on a specific script) and examine the
  scripts before running them (using the tool or in any other way),
  remember, the tool is still under development and might create extremely buggy scripts.

* DO NOT run internet --init/boot/connect/disconnect BEFORE backing up things and making sure
  you can fix what the script is about to do! Results of running
  'internet --init/boot/connect/disconnect' are at your responsibility only!

* If the usage of the scripts broke your system, please send the faulty tarball (can be found
  under <DB path>/connection/<connection name>.tar.gz) to me so it would be easier
  for me to fix the bug.

One last thing
--------------
THE DATABASE IS VERY VERY VERY V-E-R-Y EMPTY!
If you can spear a moment, read help/wizard.kwd and submit something... Thanks.

NOTE: If the tool cannot resolve the correct dialer, or cannot resolve a dialer at all,
      have a look at <DB path>/deps.xml. Add the correct entry there, run the tool,
      and if it works, submit the entry to me. Thanks.

Oh, yeah,

This is GPL (or the fact the the file COPYING already hold the GPL is enough?)
